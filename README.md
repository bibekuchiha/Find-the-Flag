# Find-the-Flag
Can you guess which continent this flag comes from?

Flag of Reunion
What are some of the features that would clue you in? Maybe some of the colors are good indicators. The presence or absence of certain shapes could give you a hint. In this project, weâ€™ll use decision trees to try to predict the continent of flags based on several of these features.

## Data Set Information:

This data file contains details of various nations and their flags. In this file the fields are separated by spaces (not commas). With this data you can try things like predicting the religion of a country from its size and the colours in its flag.

10 attributes are numeric-valued. The remainder are either Boolean- or nominal-valued.
